# Ford GoBike System Data
## Dataset

This data set includes information about 183 412individual rides made in
a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. This 
data set includes information such as the `start` and `end` station names,
`duration of the trips` and alot more. This dataset can be found on [ford.com](ford.com)


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there is no significant relationship between the age of the 
riders and how long they will take to complete their trip. It is however worthy of note that
the oldest member was identified by the other gender and as a result of this person's age, the person spent the longest
duration of time to complete the trip.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused majorly on showing that no relationship exists between the age 
of the riders and the mean duration of their trips.
